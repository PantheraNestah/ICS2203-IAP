                    Elon Reeve Musk is a businessman and investor. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$222 billion as of December 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.
                    A member of the wealthy South African Musk family, Elon was born in Pretoria and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.
                    Born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital, he has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His mother, Maye Musk, is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa. His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika, as well as a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.

                            In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link, later renamed to Zip2.The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.
                            Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.In 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition,as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.
                            Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.
                            In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access.
                            Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.
                            Over the years, Musk has engaged in numerous investments and innovations including Solarcity and Tesla Energy, The Neurolink, The Boring Company and the acquisition of Twitter now X.

                            In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company. Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software. The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.
                            Musk, through spaceX, has been working towards having reusable rockets since 2015. Since 2019, SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.

                            Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001, whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and "safe artificial intelligence"); and support science and engineering educational efforts. As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits.
                            In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity. A particular focus of the company is to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.
                            On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company has reportedly hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.
